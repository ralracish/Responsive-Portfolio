        Hi. I am 45 years old. I was born in Thomasville, GA and was raised most of my childhood in Newton Grove, NC. I graduated valedictorian of my high school class.  I was a Tarheel basketball fan and fell in love with the campus at UNC when I visited in high school. I was the first person in my extended family to go to college.  I only applied to UNC and began attending college there in 1991.  I studied abroad in Mexico City for a semester in 1993. While in school, I found a job as a Grants and Contracts Administrator at the medical school at UNC.  I started working there full time and continued my education part time. I graduated with a BA in International Studies with a concentration in Political Science and Latin America in 1997. At this point, I was also a single mom.</p>
        <p>From that position, I also became Executive Director of an international medical research membership organization, and then Administrative Director of a nonprofit that provided education and resources in the field of functional GI disorders. In these positions, I traveled all over the US and internationally to places like Toronto (twice), Rome (several times), Vienna (twice), London, and Lucerne.  I have also done accounting work for a domestic violence shelter and a CPA office, and then worked again as a Grants and Contracts Administrator at Duke University.  Now I am taking the UNC Coding Bootcamp Course to become a full stack developer and spend the next stage of my life in a career in the IT field.</p>
        <p>I have two children: Rayne, who is 23 years old and attends Georgia State, and Jacob, who is 16 years old and attends Riverside High School and Durham Tech.  I enjoy spending time with my son, boyfriend, Greg, friends, step-daughter, Destiny, and granddaughter, Nevaeh, who is 2 yrs old. I love playing Cards Against Humanity and Scrabble. I am a coffee junkie. I have a special love for cats and have a 4-year old male gray tabby named Tigger and a 7-month old female gray tabby named Bella.</p>
